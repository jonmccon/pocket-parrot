# PR Summary: Optimize Backend Endpoints for Orientation and Bulk Data

## Overview

This PR implements dedicated WebSocket endpoints to optimize data delivery based on use case requirements. The implementation separates time-critical orientation data (requiring low latency) from bulk data (GPS, weather, photos, audio) that can be efficiently batched.

## Problem Solved

Previously, all sensor data was sent through a single stream with uniform delivery characteristics. This meant:
- Real-time applications couldn't get low-latency orientation data
- High-frequency data transmission created unnecessary message overhead
- Bulk data processing had to handle individual messages instead of batches

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Low-Latency Orientation Endpoint (`/orientation`)
**Purpose**: Immediate delivery of orientation data for real-time applications

**Characteristics**:
- < 1ms latency (immediate transmission)
- Minimal payload (~200 bytes)
- Supports high-frequency updates (tested at 10 Hz)

**Use Cases**:
- Real-time 3D visualizations
- AR/VR experiences
- Interactive installations
- Motion-controlled applications

### 2. Batched Bulk Data Endpoint (`/bulk`)
**Purpose**: Efficient delivery of non-time-critical data

**Characteristics**:
- Configurable batching (default: 1s interval, max 10 items)
- 90% reduction in message overhead
- Includes GPS, weather, motion, photos, audio

**Use Cases**:
- Data logging and archival
- Analytics pipelines
- Photo/audio processing
- Weather analysis

## Technical Details

### Configuration
```javascript
const BATCH_INTERVAL = 1000;  // Send batch every 1 second
const MAX_BATCH_SIZE = 10;    // Or when 10 items accumulated
```

### Data Flow
1. Client sends sensor data to `/pocket-parrot`
2. Server extracts orientation → broadcasts immediately to `/orientation` listeners
3. Server queues bulk data → batches delivery to `/bulk` listeners
4. Existing `/listener` endpoint still receives all data (backward compatible)

### Message Formats

**Orientation Message**:
```json
{
  "type": "orientation_data",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-14T04:51:48.853Z",
  "userId": "user_123",
  "username": "Test Sender",
  "orientation": {
    "alpha": 45.5,
    "beta": 15.2,
    "gamma": -5.8,
    "compass": 45.5
  }
}
```

**Bulk Data Batch**:
```json
{
  "type": "bulk_data_batch",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-14T04:51:49.750Z",
  "batchSize": 10,
  "data": [
    {
      "timestamp": "...",
      "userId": "...",
      "gps": {...},
      "weather": {...},
      "motion": {...},
      "photoBase64": "...",
      "audioBase64": "..."
    },
    // ... up to 10 items
  ]
}
```

## Test Results

### Automated Testing
- **Script**: `server/test-new-endpoints.js`
- **Data Rate**: 10 Hz (100ms intervals)
- **Duration**: 10 seconds
- **Total Data Points**: 99

**Results**:
- ✅ Orientation: 99/99 messages delivered immediately (100%)
- ✅ Bulk: 99/99 items delivered in 10 batches (100%)
- ✅ Zero data loss
- ✅ Proper data separation verified

### Manual Testing
- **Browser Test**: `test-new-endpoints.html`
- **Dashboard**: Updated to show all listener types
- **Server**: Tested startup, operation, and shutdown

## Performance Impact

### Latency Comparison
| Endpoint | Latency | Use Case |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `/orientation` | < 1ms | Real-time UI |
| `/bulk` | ~1000ms | Background processing |
| `/listener` (existing) | Variable | General purpose |

### Bandwidth Efficiency
- **Before**: 10 messages/second = 10 WebSocket frames
- **After (orientation)**: 10 messages/second = 10 WebSocket frames (same)
- **After (bulk)**: 10 messages/second = 1 batch/second = **90% reduction**

## Backward Compatibility

### Zero Breaking Changes
✅ All existing endpoints continue to work:
- `/pocket-parrot` - Primary data sender (unchanged)
- `/dashboard` - Admin monitoring (enhanced with new stats)
- `/listener` - Passive listener (unchanged behavior)

✅ Existing clients require no modifications

✅ New endpoints are opt-in

### Migration Path
Applications can migrate incrementally:
1. Keep using `/listener` for everything (no change required)
2. Add `/orientation` connection for real-time orientation
3. Add `/bulk` connection for efficient bulk processing
4. Eventually migrate fully to specialized endpoints
