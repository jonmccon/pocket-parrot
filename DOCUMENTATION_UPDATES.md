## Key Concepts Documented

### 1. Orientation Data Handling

**What It Is:**
- Device orientation (alpha, beta, gamma) is broadcast immediately when detected
- Separate from main sensor capture cycle
- Sub-millisecond latency for real-time applications

**Why It Matters:**
- 3D visualizations, AR/VR, and interactive installations need immediate orientation updates
- Users can now build responsive applications that feel natural
- Previously undocumented feature is now clearly explained

**Where Documented:**
- `docs/DATA_ACCESS_API.md` - Orientation Data Handling section
- `readme.md` - Performance Optimization section
- `docs/INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Orientation listener example

### 2. Bulk Data Batching Strategy

**What It Is:**
- GPS, weather, motion, photos, and audio are queued and sent in batches
- Default: 1 batch per second or when 10 items accumulate
- Excludes orientation data (which is sent immediately)

**Why It Matters:**
- Reduces message overhead for analytics and logging systems
- More efficient database writes through batch processing
- Optimizes bandwidth for non-time-sensitive data

**Where Documented:**
- `server/README.md` - `/bulk` endpoint section (existing)
- `docs/DATA_ACCESS_API.md` - Endpoint Selection Guide
- `readme.md` - Recommended Usage Patterns

### 3. Endpoint Selection Guidelines

**Four Endpoints Documented:**

1. **`/orientation`** - Low-latency orientation stream
   - Latency: < 1ms
   - Payload: Minimal (orientation only)
   - Use case: 3D/AR/VR applications

2. **`/bulk`** - Batched bulk data stream
   - Latency: ~1 second
   - Payload: GPS, weather, motion, media (batched)
   - Use case: Analytics, logging, archival

3. **`/listener`** - General passive listener
   - Latency: Immediate
   - Payload: Complete data (individual messages)
   - Use case: General-purpose, development, mixed requirements

4. **`/pocket-parrot`** - Primary client endpoint
   - Latency: Immediate
   - Payload: Complete + session management
   - Use case: Pocket Parrot clients only (not for integrations)

**Where Documented:**
- All documentation files now include endpoint comparison tables
- Each guide has endpoint selection guidance appropriate to its audience

### 4. Recommended Data Rates and Protocols

**Capture Rates:**
| Interval | Use Case | Battery Impact |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| 1-5 seconds | Live tracking | Medium |
| 5-10 seconds | General monitoring | Low-Medium |
| 10-30 seconds | Analytics/research | Low |
| 30-60 seconds | Battery conservation | Very Low |
| High frequency (10-60 Hz) | Use `/orientation` endpoint | Minimal (orientation only) |

**WebSocket Protocols:**
- **WS (ws://)**: Local network, testing
- **WSS (wss://)**: Production, cellular data, required for HTTPS sites

**Where Documented:**
- `readme.md` - Recommended Usage Patterns section
- `docs/MULTI_USER_GUIDE.md` - Data Rate Management section
- `docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Data Usage Estimates

### 5. Performance Improvements

**Documented Optimizations:**

1. **Dual-Endpoint Strategy**: Use `/orientation` for real-time UI + `/bulk` for background logging
2. **Endpoint-Specific Optimization**: Choose endpoint based on latency vs. payload tradeoff
3. **Batching Benefits**: Bulk endpoint reduces message overhead by ~10x
4. **Orientation Streaming**: High-frequency orientation (10-60 Hz) with minimal bandwidth

**Performance Metrics:**
- Orientation endpoint: ~5-10 KB/hour regardless of frequency
- Bulk endpoint: Reduces message count by batching up to 10 items
- General listener: Simpler but higher message overhead

**Where Documented:**
- `readme.md` - Performance Optimization section with code examples
- `docs/DATA_ACCESS_API.md` - Performance Considerations section
- `server/README.md` - Performance Optimization: Combined Approach

## Migration Guide for Existing Integrations

### No Breaking Changes

All existing integrations continue to work without modification:
- `/pocket-parrot` endpoint unchanged
- `/dashboard` endpoint unchanged  
- `/listener` endpoint unchanged
- Message formats unchanged

### Optional Optimizations

Existing integrations can optionally upgrade to specialized endpoints:

**From `/listener` to `/orientation`** (if you only need orientation):
```javascript
// Before
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://server:8080/listener');

// After (lower latency, less bandwidth)
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://server:8080/orientation');
```

**From `/listener` to `/bulk`** (if you're doing analytics):
```javascript
// Before - individual messages
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://server:8080/listener');

// After - batched for efficiency
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://server:8080/bulk');
```
